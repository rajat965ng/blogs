    Client->>NameNode: File system namespace operations\n(opening, closing, renaming)
    NameNode->>DataNodes: Mapping of blocks to DataNodes
    DataNodes->>NameNode: Block creation, deletion, and replication
    NameNode->>Client: Response to file system operations

    Note over NameNode,DataNodes: User data never flows through NameNode

    Client->>Hive: Partitioning tables
    Hive->>Client: Efficient filter queries
    Client->>Admins: Set block size
    Admins->>Admins: Set default block size (64 MB)

    Note over Hadoop: Framework for storing and processing distributed data
