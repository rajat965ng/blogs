    Note over Nodes: Leaderless replication\nAll nodes are equal
    Nodes->>Database: Reads and writes on any node

    Note over QuorumConcept: Handling race conditions
    QuorumConcept->>Nodes: Introduce quorum
    Nodes->>QuorumConcept: Minimum nodes for consensus
    QuorumConcept->>Database: Quorum definition
    Database->>QuorumConcept: Guarantee consistency

    Note over Consistency: Choosing between fast writes and fast reads
    Consistency->>QuorumConcept: Trade-off between writes and reads
    QuorumConcept->>Database: Fast writes or fast reads
    Database->>QuorumConcept: Eventual consistency if no choice

    Note over Examples: Databases using leaderless replication
    Database->>Examples: Examples of databases
    Examples->>Database: Cassandra, Dynamo, Riak, Voldemort


    Note over Examples: Race conditions and implementations
    Examples->>Database: Race conditions in Cassandra
    Database->>Database: UPDATE operations
    Database->>Database: DELETE operations with tombstones

    Note over Examples: HDFS replication
    Examples->>Database: Reads and replication based on rack locality
    Database->>Database: All replicas are equal
