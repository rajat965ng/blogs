    Note over TypicalDesign: Backup strategy
    TypicalDesign->>TypicalDesign: One backup on same rack<br/>One backup on different rack/data center
    Note over Sharding: Sharding benefits
    Sharding->>Sharding: Scale storage, memory,<br/>processing, and locality
    Note over HDFS: Linearizability implementation
    HDFS->>HDFS: Implement deletion as<br/>append operation (logical soft delete)
    HDFS->>ReadOperations: Prevent disruptions and inconsistency<br/>to read operations
