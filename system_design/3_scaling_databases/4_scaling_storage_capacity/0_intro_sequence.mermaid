    Client->>Backend: Database size exceeds single host capacity?
    Backend-->>Client: Yes
    Client->>Backend: Delete old rows
    Backend-->>Client: Need to retain old data?
    Client->>Backend: Yes
    Backend-->>Client: Store old data in sharded storage
    Client->>ShardedStorage: Choose sharded storage (e.g., HDFS or Cassandra)
    ShardedStorage-->>Client: Sharded storage is horizontally scalable
    ShardedStorage-->>Client: Supports infinite storage capacity by adding more hosts
    ShardedStorage-->>Client: Example: Production HDFS clusters with over 100 PB
    ShardedStorage-->>Client: Theoretical: Cluster capacity of YB
    ShardedStorage-->>Client: Monetary cost prohibitive?
    Client->>Backend: No
    Backend-->>Client: Store data in consumer's devices or browser
    Backend->>Frontend: Data stored in consumer's devices or browser
    Frontend-->>Backend: Processing of data on frontend
