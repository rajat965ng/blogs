    Host ->> Checkpointing: Host goes down
    Checkpointing ->> Host: Loss of aggregated events
    Host ->> DeadLetterQueues: Loss of aggregated events
    DeadLetterQueues ->> Host: Cascading failure
    Host ->> StatelessNodes: Cascading failure
    StatelessNodes ->> Host: Earlier hosts may overflow
    Host ->> Checkpointing: Aggregated events lost
    Checkpointing ->> Host: Processing repeated
    Checkpointing ->> Host: Waste of resources
    Checkpointing ->> Host: Considerable latency
    Host ->> StatelessNodes: Convert each node into independent service
    StatelessNodes ->> RedisCluster: Cluster of stateless nodes
    StatelessNodes ->> LoadBalancingService: Multiple hosts
    LoadBalancingService ->> StatelessNodes: Spread requests across hosts
    StatelessNodes ->> RedisCluster: Separate Redis cluster
    RedisCluster ->> RedisCluster: No competition for writing
    RedisCluster ->> RedisCluster: Aggregated events deleted after flush
    RedisCluster ->> RedisCluster: Controlled database size
