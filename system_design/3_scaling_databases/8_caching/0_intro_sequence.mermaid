    Note over Database, Cache: Technical Details

    Service->>Database: Execute Queries
    Service->>Cache: Check Cache
    alt Cache Hit
        Cache-->>Service: Return Cached Data
    else Cache Miss
        Database-->>Service: Retrieve Data
        Service->>Cache: Store Data in Cache
    end

    Note over Cache: Benefits of Caching

    Note over Cache: Performance: Faster and more expensive memory compared to disk-based database

    Note over Cache: Availability: Service remains available even if database is unavailable, but only for cached data

    Note over Cache: Scalability: Cache serves frequently requested data, reducing load on backend

    Note over Cache: Trade-offs:
    Note over Cache: - Designed for high performance and low latency, not high availability
    Note over Cache: - May make trade-offs against availability for performance
    Note over Cache: - Inadvisable to replicate cache across data centers due to latency concerns

    Service->>Applications: Return Data
