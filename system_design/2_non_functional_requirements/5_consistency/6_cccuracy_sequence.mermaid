    Note over System: Accuracy is a relevant non-functional requirement

    System ->> EstimationAlgorithms: Estimation algorithms trade off accuracy for complexity
    EstimationAlgorithms ->> System: Examples: HyperLogLog, Count-min sketch

    Note over System: HyperLogLog used for COUNT DISTINCT estimate in Presto

    System ->> Presto: HyperLogLog for cardinality estimation

    Note over System: Cache becomes stale if underlying data modified

    System ->> Cache: Data modification in underlying database

    Note over Cache: Cache may have refresh policy

    Cache ->> Database: Fetch latest data at periodic interval
    Database ->> Cache: Send updated data

    Note over Cache: Short refresh policy is more costly

    Note over Cache: Alternative is to update or delete cache key upon data modification

    Note over System: Accuracy somewhat related to consistency

    System ->> System: Eventually consistent systems trade off accuracy for availability, complexity, and cost

    Note over System: Results from reads may not include effects of recent writes

    System ->> System: Eventually consistent system is inaccurate until replicas updated

    Note over System: Inaccuracy addressed in consistency, not accuracy

    Note over System: Example of estimation algorithm for stream data

    System ->> Stream: Count-min sketch for estimating frequencies
